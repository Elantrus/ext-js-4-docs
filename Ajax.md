# Ext.Ajax

**Extends:** Ext.data.Connection

## Descrição

A singleton instance of an Ext.data.Connection. This class
is used to communicate with your server side code. It can be used as follows:

Ext.Ajax.request({
    url: 'page.php',
    params: {
        id: 1
    },
    success: function(response){
        var text = response.responseText;
        // process server response here
    }
});


Default options for all requests can be set by changing a property on the Ext.Ajax class:

Ext.Ajax.timeout = 60000; // 60 seconds


Any options specified in the request method for the Ajax request will override any
defaults set on the Ext.Ajax class. In the code sample below, the timeout for the
request will be 60 seconds.

Ext.Ajax.timeout = 120000; // 120 seconds
Ext.Ajax.request({
    url: 'page.aspx',
    timeout: 60000
});


In general, this class will be used for all Ajax requests in your application.
The main reason for creating a separate Ext.data.Connection is for a
series of requests that share common settings that are different to all other
requests in the application.

## Config options

### binary

**Tipo:** Boolean

True if the response should be treated as binary data. ...

True if the response should be treated as binary data.  If true, the binary
data will be accessible as a "responseBytes" property on the response object.
Defaults to: `false`


### cors

**Tipo:** Boolean

True to enable CORS support on the XHR object. ...

True to enable CORS support on the XHR object. Currently the only effect of this option
is to use the XDomainRequest object instead of XMLHttpRequest if the browser is IE8 or above.
Defaults to: `false`


### disableCachingParam

**Tipo:** String

Change the parameter which is sent went disabling caching through a cache buster. ...

Change the parameter which is sent went disabling caching through a cache buster.
Defaults to: `'_dc'`


### listeners

**Tipo:** Object

A config object containing one or more event handlers to be added to this object during initialization. ...

A config object containing one or more event handlers to be added to this object during initialization. This
should be a valid listeners config object as specified in the addListener example for attaching multiple
handlers at once.

**DOM events from Ext JS Components**

While *some* Ext JS Component classes export selected DOM events (e.g. "click", "mouseover" etc), this is usually
only done when extra value can be added. For example the DataView's **`itemclick`** event passing the node clicked on. To access DOM events directly from a
child element of a Component, we need to specify the `element` option to identify the Component property to add a
DOM listener to:

new Ext.panel.Panel({
    width: 400,
    height: 200,
    dockedItems: [{
        xtype: 'toolbar'
    }],
    listeners: {
        click: {
            element: 'el', //bind to the underlying el property on the panel
            fn: function(){ console.log('click el'); }
        },
        dblclick: {
            element: 'body', //bind to the underlying body property on the panel
            fn: function(){ console.log('dblclick body'); }
        }
    }
});


### withCredentials

**Tipo:** Boolean

True to set withCredentials = true on the XHR object ...

True to set `withCredentials = true` on the XHR object
Defaults to: `false`


### $className

...

Defaults to: `'Ext.Base'`


### async

**Tipo:** Boolean

...

Defaults to: `true`


### autoAbort

**Tipo:** Boolean

Whether a new request should abort any pending requests. ...

Whether a new request should abort any pending requests.
Defaults to: `false`


### configMap

**Tipo:** Object

...

Defaults to: `{}`


### defaultHeaders

**Tipo:** Object

An object containing request headers which are added to each request made by this object.


### defaultPostHeader

**Tipo:** String

...

Defaults to: `'application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8'`


### defaultXdrContentType

**Tipo:** String

...

Defaults to: `'text/plain'`


### defaultXhrHeader

**Tipo:** String

...

Defaults to: `'XMLHttpRequest'`

True to add a unique cache-buster param to GET requests. Defaults to true.


### eventsSuspended

**Tipo:** Number

Initial suspended call count. ...

Initial suspended call count. Incremented when suspendEvents is called, decremented when resumeEvents is called.
Defaults to: `0`


### extraParams

**Tipo:** Object

An object containing properties which are used as extra parameters to each request made
by this object. ...

An object containing properties which are used as extra parameters to each request made
by this object. Session information and other data that you need
to pass with each request are commonly put here.


### getXhrInstance

**Tipo:** Object

Creates the appropriate XHR transport for this browser.


### hasListeners

**Tipo:** Object

This object holds a key for any event that has a listener. ...

This object holds a key for any event that has a listener. The listener may be set
directly on the instance, or on its class or a super class (via observe) or
on the MVC EventBus. The values of this object are truthy
(a non-zero number) and falsy (0 or undefined). They do not represent an exact count
of listeners. The value for an event is truthy if the event must be fired and is
falsy if there is no need to fire the event.

The intended use of this property is to avoid the expense of fireEvent calls when
there are no listeners. This can be particularly helpful when one would otherwise
have to call fireEvent hundreds or thousands of times. It is used like this:

 if (this.hasListeners.foo) {
     this.fireEvent('foo', this, arg1);
 }

should be all caps (if not set but params are present will use
"POST", otherwise will use "GET".)
Overrides: Ext.data.Connection.method


### password

**Tipo:** String

...

Defaults to: `''`


### self

**Tipo:** Ext.Class

Get the reference to the current class from which this object was instantiated. ...

Get the reference to the current class from which this object was instantiated. Unlike statics,
`this.self` is scope-dependent and it's meant to be used for dynamic inheritance. See statics
for a detailed comparison

Ext.define('My.Cat', {
    statics: {
        speciesName: 'Cat' // My.Cat.speciesName = 'Cat'
    },

    constructor: function() {
        alert(this.self.speciesName); // dependent on 'this'
    },

    clone: function() {
        return new this.self();
    }
});


Ext.define('My.SnowLeopard', {
    extend: 'My.Cat',
    statics: {
        speciesName: 'Snow Leopard'         // My.SnowLeopard.speciesName = 'Snow Leopard'
    }
});

var cat = new My.Cat();                     // alerts 'Cat'
var snowLeopard = new My.SnowLeopard();     // alerts 'Snow Leopard'

If the server receives all requests through one URL, setting this once is easier than
entering it on every request.
Overrides: Ext.data.Connection.url


### useDefaultXhrHeader

**Tipo:** Boolean

...

Defaults to: `true`


### username

**Tipo:** String

...

Defaults to: `''`


### $onExtended

**Tipo:** Array

...

Defaults to: `[]`

### addEvents

Adds the specified events to the list of events which this Observable may fire. ...

Adds the specified events to the list of events which this Observable may fire.
ParameterseventNames : Object/String...Either an object with event names as properties with
a value of `true`. For example:

this.addEvents({
    storeloaded: true,
    storecleared: true
});


Or any number of event names as separate parameters. For example:

this.addEvents('storeloaded', 'storecleared');


### addListener

Appends an event handler to this object. ...

Appends an event handler to this object.  For example:

myGridPanel.on("mouseover", this.onMouseOver, this);


The method also allows for a single argument to be passed which is a config object
containing properties which specify multiple events. For example:

myGridPanel.on({
    cellClick: this.onCellClick,
    mouseover: this.onMouseOver,
    mouseout: this.onMouseOut,
    scope: this // Important. Ensure "this" is correct during handler execution
});


One can also specify options for each event handler separately:

myGridPanel.on({
    cellClick: {fn: this.onCellClick, scope: this, single: true},
    mouseover: {fn: panel.onMouseOver, scope: panel}
});


*Names* of methods in a specified scope may also be used. Note that
`scope` MUST be specified to use this option:

myGridPanel.on({
    cellClick: {fn: 'onCellClick', scope: this, single: true},
    mouseover: {fn: 'onMouseOver', scope: panel}
});

ParameterseventName : String/ObjectThe name of the event to listen for.
May also be an object who's property names are event names.

Adds listeners to any Observable object (or Ext.Element) which are automatically removed when this Component is
destroyed.
Parametersitem : Ext.util.Observable/Ext.ElementThe item to which to add a listener/listeners.


### callOverridden

Call the original method that was previously overridden with override

Ext.define('My.Cat', {
    constructor: functi...

Call the original method that was previously overridden with override

Ext.define('My.Cat', {
    constructor: function() {
        alert("I'm a cat!");
    }
});

My.Cat.override({
    constructor: function() {
        alert("I'm going to be a cat!");

        this.callOverridden();

        alert("Meeeeoooowwww");
    }
});

var kitty = new My.Cat(); // alerts "I'm going to be a cat!"
                          // alerts "I'm a cat!"
                          // alerts "Meeeeoooowwww"

        
        This method has been **deprecated** 
        as of 4.1. Use callParent instead.


### callParent

Call the "parent" method of the current method. ...

Call the "parent" method of the current method. That is the method previously
overridden by derivation or by an override (see Ext.define).

 Ext.define('My.Base', {
     constructor: function (x) {
         this.x = x;
     },

     statics: {
         method: function (x) {
             return x;
         }
     }
 });

 Ext.define('My.Derived', {
     extend: 'My.Base',

     constructor: function () {
         this.callParent([21]);
     }
 });

 var obj = new My.Derived();

 alert(obj.x);  // alerts 21


This can be used with an override as follows:

 Ext.define('My.DerivedOverride', {
     override: 'My.Derived',

     constructor: function (x) {
         this.callParent([x*2]); // calls original My.Derived constructor
     }
 });

 var obj = new My.Derived();

 alert(obj.x);  // now alerts 42


This also works with static methods.

 Ext.define('My.Derived2', {
     extend: 'My.Base',

     statics: {
         method: function (x) {
             return this.callParent([x*2]); // calls My.Base.method
         }
     }
 });

 alert(My.Base.method(10);     // alerts 10
 alert(My.Derived2.method(10); // alerts 20


Lastly, it also works with overridden static methods.

 Ext.define('My.Derived2Override', {
     override: 'My.Derived2',

     statics: {
         method: function (x) {
             return this.callParent([x*2]); // calls My.Derived2.method
         }
     }
 });

 alert(My.Derived2.method(10); // now alerts 40


To override a method and replace it and also call the superclass method, use
callSuper. This is often done to patch a method to fix a bug.
Parametersargs : Array/ArgumentsThe arguments, either an array or the `arguments` object
from the current method, for example: `this.callParent(arguments)`


### callSuper

This method is used by an override to call the superclass method but bypass any
overridden method. ...

This method is used by an override to call the superclass method but bypass any
overridden method. This is often done to "patch" a method that contains a bug
but for whatever reason cannot be fixed directly.

Consider:

 Ext.define('Ext.some.Class', {
     method: function () {
         console.log('Good');
     }
 });

 Ext.define('Ext.some.DerivedClass', {
     method: function () {
         console.log('Bad');

         // ... logic but with a bug ...

         this.callParent();
     }
 });


To patch the bug in `DerivedClass.method`, the typical solution is to create an
override:

 Ext.define('App.paches.DerivedClass', {
     override: 'Ext.some.DerivedClass',

     method: function () {
         console.log('Fixed');

         // ... logic but with bug fixed ...

         this.callSuper();
     }
 });


The patch method cannot use `callParent` to call the superclass `method` since
that would call the overridden method containing the bug. In other words, the
above patch would only produce "Fixed" then "Good" in the console log, whereas,
using `callParent` would produce "Fixed" then "Bad" then "Good".
Parametersargs : Array/ArgumentsThe arguments, either an array or the `arguments` object
from the current method, for example: `this.callSuper(arguments)`

### enableBubble

Enables events fired by this Observable to bubble up an owner hierarchy by calling this.getBubbleTarget() if
present. ...

Enables events fired by this Observable to bubble up an owner hierarchy by calling `this.getBubbleTarget()` if
present. There is no implementation in the Observable base class.

This is commonly used by Ext.Components to bubble events to owner Containers.
See Ext.Component.getBubbleTarget. The default implementation in Ext.Component returns the
Component's immediate owner. But if a known target is required, this can be overridden to access the
required target more quickly.

Example:

Ext.define('Ext.overrides.form.field.Base', {
    override: 'Ext.form.field.Base',

    //  Add functionality to Field's initComponent to enable the change event to bubble
    initComponent: function () {
        this.callParent();
        this.enableBubble('change');
    }
});

var myForm = Ext.create('Ext.form.Panel', {
    title: 'User Details',
    items: [{
        ...
    }],
    listeners: {
        change: function() {
            // Title goes red if form has been modified.
            myForm.header.setStyle('color', 'red');
        }
    }
});

### relayEvents

Relays selected events from the specified Observable as if the events were fired by this. ...

Relays selected events from the specified Observable as if the events were fired by `this`.

For example if you are extending Grid, you might decide to forward some events from store.
So you can do this inside your initComponent:

this.relayEvents(this.getStore(), ['load']);


The grid instance will then have an observable 'load' event which will be passed the
parameters of the store's load event and any function fired with the grid's load event
would have access to the grid using the `this` keyword.

### request

Sends an HTTP request to a remote server. ...

Sends an HTTP request to a remote server.

**Important:** Ajax server requests are asynchronous, and this call will
return before the response has been received. Process any returned data
in a callback function.

Ext.Ajax.request({
    url: 'ajax_demo/sample.json',
    success: function(response, opts) {
        var obj = Ext.decode(response.responseText);
        console.dir(obj);
    },
    failure: function(response, opts) {
        console.log('server-side failure with status code ' + response.status);
    }
});


To execute a callback function in the correct scope, use the `scope` option.
Parametersoptions : ObjectAn object which may contain the following properties:

(The options object may also contain any other property which might be needed to perform
postprocessing in a callback because it is passed to callback functions.)
url : String/FunctionThe URL to which to send the request, or a function
to call which returns a URL string. The scope of the function is specified by the `scope` option.
Defaults to the configured `url`.


### resumeEvent

After calling this method to resume events, the events will fire when requested to fire.

Note that if the suspendEvent method is called multiple times for a certain event,
this converse method will have to be called the same number of times for it to resume firing.
ParameterseventName : String...Multiple event names to resume.


### resumeEvents

### override

Override members of this class. ...

Override members of this class. Overridden methods can be invoked via
callParent.

Ext.define('My.Cat', {
    constructor: function() {
        alert("I'm a cat!");
    }
});

My.Cat.override({
    constructor: function() {
        alert("I'm going to be a cat!");

        this.callParent(arguments);

        alert("Meeeeoooowwww");
    }
});

var kitty = new My.Cat(); // alerts "I'm going to be a cat!"
                          // alerts "I'm a cat!"
                          // alerts "Meeeeoooowwww"


As of 4.1, direct use of this method is deprecated. Use Ext.define
instead:

Ext.define('My.CatOverride', {
    override: 'My.Cat',
    constructor: function() {
        alert("I'm going to be a cat!");

        this.callParent(arguments);

        alert("Meeeeoooowwww");
    }
});


The above accomplishes the same result but can be managed by the Ext.Loader
which can properly order the override and its target class and the build process
can determine whether the override is needed based on the required state of the
target class (My.Cat).
        
        This method has been **deprecated** since 4.1.0
        Use Ext.define instead

### hasListeners

**Tipo:** Object

This object holds a key for any event that has a listener. ...

This object holds a key for any event that has a listener. The listener may be set
directly on the instance, or on its class or a super class (via observe) or
on the MVC EventBus. The values of this object are truthy
(a non-zero number) and falsy (0 or undefined). They do not represent an exact count
of listeners. The value for an event is truthy if the event must be fired and is
falsy if there is no need to fire the event.

The intended use of this property is to avoid the expense of fireEvent calls when
there are no listeners. This can be particularly helpful when one would otherwise
have to call fireEvent hundreds or thousands of times. It is used like this:

 if (this.hasListeners.foo) {
     this.fireEvent('foo', this, arg1);
 }

    statics: {
        speciesName: 'Cat' // My.Cat.speciesName = 'Cat'
    },

Adds the specified events to the list of events which this Observable may fire.
ParameterseventNames : Object/String...Either an object with event names as properties with
a value of `true`. For example:

this.addEvents({
    storeloaded: true,
    storecleared: true
});


Or any number of event names as separate parameters. For example:

this.addEvents('storeloaded', 'storecleared');


### addListener

Appends an event handler to this object. ...

Appends an event handler to this object.  For example:

myGridPanel.on("mouseover", this.onMouseOver, this);


The method also allows for a single argument to be passed which is a config object
containing properties which specify multiple events. For example:

myGridPanel.on({
    cellClick: this.onCellClick,
    mouseover: this.onMouseOver,
    mouseout: this.onMouseOut,
    scope: this // Important. Ensure "this" is correct during handler execution
});


One can also specify options for each event handler separately:

myGridPanel.on({
    cellClick: {fn: this.onCellClick, scope: this, single: true},
    mouseover: {fn: panel.onMouseOver, scope: panel}
});


*Names* of methods in a specified scope may also be used. Note that
`scope` MUST be specified to use this option:

myGridPanel.on({
    cellClick: {fn: 'onCellClick', scope: this, single: true},
    mouseover: {fn: 'onMouseOver', scope: panel}
});

ParameterseventName : String/ObjectThe name of the event to listen for.
May also be an object who's property names are event names.

Call the original method that was previously overridden with override

Ext.define('My.Cat', {
    constructor: function() {
        alert("I'm a cat!");
    }
});

My.Cat.override({
    constructor: function() {
        alert("I'm going to be a cat!");

        this.callOverridden();

        alert("Meeeeoooowwww");
    }
});

var kitty = new My.Cat(); // alerts "I'm going to be a cat!"
                          // alerts "I'm a cat!"
                          // alerts "Meeeeoooowwww"

        
        This method has been **deprecated** 
        as of 4.1. Use callParent instead.


### callParent

Call the "parent" method of the current method. ...

Call the "parent" method of the current method. That is the method previously
overridden by derivation or by an override (see Ext.define).

 Ext.define('My.Base', {
     constructor: function (x) {
         this.x = x;
     },

     statics: {
         method: function (x) {
             return x;
         }
     }
 });

 Ext.define('My.Derived', {
     extend: 'My.Base',

     constructor: function () {
         this.callParent([21]);
     }
 });

 var obj = new My.Derived();

 alert(obj.x);  // alerts 21


This can be used with an override as follows:

 Ext.define('My.DerivedOverride', {
     override: 'My.Derived',

     constructor: function (x) {
         this.callParent([x*2]); // calls original My.Derived constructor
     }
 });

 var obj = new My.Derived();

 alert(obj.x);  // now alerts 42


This also works with static methods.

 Ext.define('My.Derived2', {
     extend: 'My.Base',

     statics: {
         method: function (x) {
             return this.callParent([x*2]); // calls My.Base.method
         }
     }
 });

 alert(My.Base.method(10);     // alerts 10
 alert(My.Derived2.method(10); // alerts 20


Lastly, it also works with overridden static methods.

 Ext.define('My.Derived2Override', {
     override: 'My.Derived2',

     statics: {
         method: function (x) {
             return this.callParent([x*2]); // calls My.Derived2.method
         }
     }
 });

 alert(My.Derived2.method(10); // now alerts 40


To override a method and replace it and also call the superclass method, use
callSuper. This is often done to patch a method to fix a bug.
Parametersargs : Array/ArgumentsThe arguments, either an array or the `arguments` object
from the current method, for example: `this.callParent(arguments)`


### callSuper

This method is used by an override to call the superclass method but bypass any
overridden method. ...

This method is used by an override to call the superclass method but bypass any
overridden method. This is often done to "patch" a method that contains a bug
but for whatever reason cannot be fixed directly.

Consider:

 Ext.define('Ext.some.Class', {
     method: function () {
         console.log('Good');
     }
 });

 Ext.define('Ext.some.DerivedClass', {
     method: function () {
         console.log('Bad');

         // ... logic but with a bug ...

         this.callParent();
     }
 });


To patch the bug in `DerivedClass.method`, the typical solution is to create an
override:

 Ext.define('App.paches.DerivedClass', {
     override: 'Ext.some.DerivedClass',

     method: function () {
         console.log('Fixed');

         // ... logic but with bug fixed ...

         this.callSuper();
     }
 });


The patch method cannot use `callParent` to call the superclass `method` since
that would call the overridden method containing the bug. In other words, the
above patch would only produce "Fixed" then "Good" in the console log, whereas,
using `callParent` would produce "Fixed" then "Bad" then "Good".
Parametersargs : Array/ArgumentsThe arguments, either an array or the `arguments` object
from the current method, for example: `this.callSuper(arguments)`

### enableBubble

Enables events fired by this Observable to bubble up an owner hierarchy by calling this.getBubbleTarget() if
present. ...

Enables events fired by this Observable to bubble up an owner hierarchy by calling `this.getBubbleTarget()` if
present. There is no implementation in the Observable base class.

This is commonly used by Ext.Components to bubble events to owner Containers.
See Ext.Component.getBubbleTarget. The default implementation in Ext.Component returns the
Component's immediate owner. But if a known target is required, this can be overridden to access the
required target more quickly.

Example:

Ext.define('Ext.overrides.form.field.Base', {
    override: 'Ext.form.field.Base',

    //  Add functionality to Field's initComponent to enable the change event to bubble
    initComponent: function () {
        this.callParent();
        this.enableBubble('change');
    }
});

var myForm = Ext.create('Ext.form.Panel', {
    title: 'User Details',
    items: [{
        ...
    }],
    listeners: {
        change: function() {
            // Title goes red if form has been modified.
            myForm.header.setStyle('color', 'red');
        }
    }
});

Parametersoptions : Object


### on

Shorthand for addListener. ...

Shorthand for addListener.

Appends an event handler to this object.  For example:

myGridPanel.on("mouseover", this.onMouseOver, this);


The method also allows for a single argument to be passed which is a config object
containing properties which specify multiple events. For example:

myGridPanel.on({
    cellClick: this.onCellClick,
    mouseover: this.onMouseOver,
    mouseout: this.onMouseOut,
    scope: this // Important. Ensure "this" is correct during handler execution
});


One can also specify options for each event handler separately:

myGridPanel.on({
    cellClick: {fn: this.onCellClick, scope: this, single: true},
    mouseover: {fn: panel.onMouseOver, scope: panel}
});


*Names* of methods in a specified scope may also be used. Note that
`scope` MUST be specified to use this option:

myGridPanel.on({
    cellClick: {fn: 'onCellClick', scope: this, single: true},
    mouseover: {fn: 'onMouseOver', scope: panel}
});

ParameterseventName : String/ObjectThe name of the event to listen for.

### relayEvents

Relays selected events from the specified Observable as if the events were fired by this. ...

Relays selected events from the specified Observable as if the events were fired by `this`.

For example if you are extending Grid, you might decide to forward some events from store.
So you can do this inside your initComponent:

this.relayEvents(this.getStore(), ['load']);


The grid instance will then have an observable 'load' event which will be passed the
parameters of the store's load event and any function fired with the grid's load event
would have access to the grid using the `this` keyword.
Parametersorigin : ObjectThe Observable whose events this object is to relay.

### request

Sends an HTTP request to a remote server. ...

Sends an HTTP request to a remote server.

**Important:** Ajax server requests are asynchronous, and this call will
return before the response has been received. Process any returned data
in a callback function.

Ext.Ajax.request({
    url: 'ajax_demo/sample.json',
    success: function(response, opts) {
        var obj = Ext.decode(response.responseText);
        console.dir(obj);
    },
    failure: function(response, opts) {
        console.log('server-side failure with status code ' + response.status);
    }
});


To execute a callback function in the correct scope, use the `scope` option.
Parametersoptions : ObjectAn object which may contain the following properties:

(The options object may also contain any other property which might be needed to perform
postprocessing in a callback because it is passed to callback functions.)
url : String/FunctionThe URL to which to send the request, or a function
to call which returns a URL string. The scope of the function is specified by the `scope` option.
Defaults to the configured `url`.

### override

Override members of this class. ...

Override members of this class. Overridden methods can be invoked via
callParent.

Ext.define('My.Cat', {
    constructor: function() {
        alert("I'm a cat!");
    }
});

My.Cat.override({
    constructor: function() {
        alert("I'm going to be a cat!");

        this.callParent(arguments);

        alert("Meeeeoooowwww");
    }
});

var kitty = new My.Cat(); // alerts "I'm going to be a cat!"
                          // alerts "I'm a cat!"
                          // alerts "Meeeeoooowwww"


As of 4.1, direct use of this method is deprecated. Use Ext.define
instead:

Ext.define('My.CatOverride', {
    override: 'My.Cat',
    constructor: function() {
        alert("I'm going to be a cat!");

        this.callParent(arguments);

        alert("Meeeeoooowwww");
    }
});


The above accomplishes the same result but can be managed by the Ext.Loader
which can properly order the override and its target class and the build process
can determine whether the override is needed based on the required state of the
target class (My.Cat).
        
        This method has been **deprecated** since 4.1.0
        Use Ext.define instead

});


Or any number of event names as separate parameters. For example:

this.addEvents('storeloaded', 'storecleared');


### addListener

Appends an event handler to this object.  For example:

myGridPanel.on("mouseover", this.onMouseOver, this);


The method also allows for a single argument to be passed which is a config object
containing properties which specify multiple events. For example:

myGridPanel.on({
    cellClick: this.onCellClick,
    mouseover: this.onMouseOver,
    mouseout: this.onMouseOut,
    scope: this // Important. Ensure "this" is correct during handler execution
});


One can also specify options for each event handler separately:

myGridPanel.on({
    cellClick: {fn: this.onCellClick, scope: this, single: true},
    mouseover: {fn: panel.onMouseOver, scope: panel}
});


*Names* of methods in a specified scope may also be used. Note that
`scope` MUST be specified to use this option:

myGridPanel.on({
    cellClick: {fn: 'onCellClick', scope: this, single: true},
    mouseover: {fn: 'onMouseOver', scope: panel}
});

ParameterseventName : String/ObjectThe name of the event to listen for.

        alert("I'm a cat!");
    }
});

        alert("I'm going to be a cat!");

        this.callOverridden();

        alert("Meeeeoooowwww");
    }
});

var kitty = new My.Cat(); // alerts "I'm going to be a cat!"
                          // alerts "I'm a cat!"
                          // alerts "Meeeeoooowwww"

        
        This method has been **deprecated** 
        as of 4.1. Use callParent instead.


### callParent

Call the "parent" method of the current method. ...

Call the "parent" method of the current method. That is the method previously
overridden by derivation or by an override (see Ext.define).

 Ext.define('My.Base', {
     constructor: function (x) {
         this.x = x;
     },

     statics: {
         method: function (x) {
             return x;
         }
     }
 });

 Ext.define('My.Derived', {
     extend: 'My.Base',

     constructor: function () {
         this.callParent([21]);
     }
 });

 var obj = new My.Derived();

 alert(obj.x);  // alerts 21


This can be used with an override as follows:

 Ext.define('My.DerivedOverride', {
     override: 'My.Derived',

     constructor: function (x) {
         this.callParent([x*2]); // calls original My.Derived constructor
     }
 });

 var obj = new My.Derived();

 alert(obj.x);  // now alerts 42


This also works with static methods.

 Ext.define('My.Derived2', {
     extend: 'My.Base',

     statics: {
         method: function (x) {
             return this.callParent([x*2]); // calls My.Base.method
         }
     }
 });

 alert(My.Base.method(10);     // alerts 10
 alert(My.Derived2.method(10); // alerts 20


Lastly, it also works with overridden static methods.

 Ext.define('My.Derived2Override', {
     override: 'My.Derived2',

     statics: {
         method: function (x) {
             return this.callParent([x*2]); // calls My.Derived2.method
         }
     }
 });

 alert(My.Derived2.method(10); // now alerts 40


To override a method and replace it and also call the superclass method, use
callSuper. This is often done to patch a method to fix a bug.
Parametersargs : Array/ArgumentsThe arguments, either an array or the `arguments` object
from the current method, for example: `this.callParent(arguments)`


### callSuper

This method is used by an override to call the superclass method but bypass any
overridden method. ...

This method is used by an override to call the superclass method but bypass any
overridden method. This is often done to "patch" a method that contains a bug
but for whatever reason cannot be fixed directly.

Consider:

 Ext.define('Ext.some.Class', {
     method: function () {
         console.log('Good');
     }
 });

 Ext.define('Ext.some.DerivedClass', {
     method: function () {
         console.log('Bad');

         // ... logic but with a bug ...

         this.callParent();
     }
 });


To patch the bug in `DerivedClass.method`, the typical solution is to create an
override:

 Ext.define('App.paches.DerivedClass', {
     override: 'Ext.some.DerivedClass',

     method: function () {
         console.log('Fixed');

         // ... logic but with bug fixed ...

         this.callSuper();
     }
 });


The patch method cannot use `callParent` to call the superclass `method` since
that would call the overridden method containing the bug. In other words, the
above patch would only produce "Fixed" then "Good" in the console log, whereas,
using `callParent` would produce "Fixed" then "Bad" then "Good".
Parametersargs : Array/ArgumentsThe arguments, either an array or the `arguments` object
from the current method, for example: `this.callSuper(arguments)`

### enableBubble

Enables events fired by this Observable to bubble up an owner hierarchy by calling this.getBubbleTarget() if
present. ...

Enables events fired by this Observable to bubble up an owner hierarchy by calling `this.getBubbleTarget()` if
present. There is no implementation in the Observable base class.

This is commonly used by Ext.Components to bubble events to owner Containers.
See Ext.Component.getBubbleTarget. The default implementation in Ext.Component returns the
Component's immediate owner. But if a known target is required, this can be overridden to access the
required target more quickly.

Example:

Ext.define('Ext.overrides.form.field.Base', {
    override: 'Ext.form.field.Base',

    //  Add functionality to Field's initComponent to enable the change event to bubble
    initComponent: function () {
        this.callParent();
        this.enableBubble('change');
    }
});

var myForm = Ext.create('Ext.form.Panel', {
    title: 'User Details',
    items: [{
        ...
    }],
    listeners: {
        change: function() {
            // Title goes red if form has been modified.
            myForm.header.setStyle('color', 'red');
        }
    }
});

### on

Shorthand for addListener. ...

Shorthand for addListener.

Appends an event handler to this object.  For example:

myGridPanel.on("mouseover", this.onMouseOver, this);


The method also allows for a single argument to be passed which is a config object
containing properties which specify multiple events. For example:

myGridPanel.on({
    cellClick: this.onCellClick,
    mouseover: this.onMouseOver,
    mouseout: this.onMouseOut,
    scope: this // Important. Ensure "this" is correct during handler execution
});

myGridPanel.on({
    cellClick: {fn: this.onCellClick, scope: this, single: true},
    mouseover: {fn: panel.onMouseOver, scope: panel}
});


*Names* of methods in a specified scope may also be used. Note that
`scope` MUST be specified to use this option:

### request

Sends an HTTP request to a remote server. ...

Sends an HTTP request to a remote server.

**Important:** Ajax server requests are asynchronous, and this call will
return before the response has been received. Process any returned data
in a callback function.

Ext.Ajax.request({
    url: 'ajax_demo/sample.json',
    success: function(response, opts) {
        var obj = Ext.decode(response.responseText);
        console.dir(obj);
    },
    failure: function(response, opts) {

Parametersoptions : ObjectAn object which may contain the following properties:

(The options object may also contain any other property which might be needed to perform
postprocessing in a callback because it is passed to callback functions.)
url : String/FunctionThe URL to which to send the request, or a function
to call which returns a URL string. The scope of the function is specified by the `scope` option.
Defaults to the configured `url`.

### override

Override members of this class. ...

Override members of this class. Overridden methods can be invoked via
callParent.

Ext.define('My.Cat', {
    constructor: function() {
        alert("I'm a cat!");
    }
});

My.Cat.override({
    constructor: function() {
        alert("I'm going to be a cat!");

        this.callParent(arguments);

        alert("Meeeeoooowwww");
    }
});

var kitty = new My.Cat(); // alerts "I'm going to be a cat!"
                          // alerts "I'm a cat!"
                          // alerts "Meeeeoooowwww"


As of 4.1, direct use of this method is deprecated. Use Ext.define
instead:

Ext.define('My.CatOverride', {
    override: 'My.Cat',
    constructor: function() {
        alert("I'm going to be a cat!");

        this.callParent(arguments);

        alert("Meeeeoooowwww");
    }
});


The above accomplishes the same result but can be managed by the Ext.Loader
which can properly order the override and its target class and the build process
can determine whether the override is needed based on the required state of the
target class (My.Cat).
        
        This method has been **deprecated** since 4.1.0
        Use Ext.define instead
