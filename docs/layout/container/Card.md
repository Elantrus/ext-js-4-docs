# Ext.layout.container.Card

**Extends:** Ext.layout.container.Fit

**Alternate Names:** Ext.layout.CardLayout

## Description

This layout manages multiple child Components, each fitted to the Container, where only a single child Component can be visible at any given time. This layout style is most commonly used for wizards, tab implementations, etc. This class is intended to be extended or created via the layout:'card' Ext.container.Container.layout config, and should generally not need to be created directly via the new keyword.

The CardLayout's focal method is setActiveItem. Since only one panel is displayed at a time, the only way to move from one Component to the next is by calling setActiveItem, passing the next panel to display (or its id or index). The layout itself does not provide a user interface for handling this navigation, so that functionality must be provided by the developer.

To change the active card of a container, call the setActiveItem method of its layout:

var p = Ext.create('Ext.panel.Panel', { layout: 'card', items: [ { html: 'Card 1' }, { html: 'Card 2' } ], renderTo: Ext.getBody() }); p.getLayout().setActiveItem(1); The beforedeactivate and beforeactivate events can be used to prevent a card from activating or deactivating by returning `false`.

var active = 0; var main = Ext.create('Ext.panel.Panel', { renderTo: Ext.getBody(), width: 200, height: 200, layout: 'card', tbar: [{ text: 'Next', handler: function(){ var layout = main.getLayout(); ++active; layout.setActiveItem(active); active = main.items.indexOf(layout.getActiveItem()); } }], items: [{ title: 'P1' }, { title: 'P2' }, { title: 'P3', listeners: { beforeactivate: function(){ return false; } } }] }); In the following example, a simplistic wizard setup is demonstrated. A button bar is added to the footer of the containing panel to provide navigation buttons. The buttons will be handled by a common navigation routine. Note that other uses of a CardLayout (like a tab control) would require a completely different implementation. For serious implementations, a better approach would be to extend CardLayout to provide the custom functionality needed.

## Examples

### Example 1

```javascript
var p = Ext.create('Ext.panel.Panel', { layout: 'card', items: [ { html: 'Card 1' }, { html: 'Card 2' } ], renderTo: Ext.getBody() }); p.getLayout().setActiveItem(1);
```

### Example 2

```javascript
var active = 0; var main = Ext.create('Ext.panel.Panel', { renderTo: Ext.getBody(), width: 200, height: 200, layout: 'card', tbar: [{ text: 'Next', handler: function(){ var layout = main.getLayout(); ++active; layout.setActiveItem(active); active = main.items.indexOf(layout.getActiveItem()); } }], items: [{ title: 'P1' }, { title: 'P2' }, { title: 'P3', listeners: { beforeactivate: function(){ return false; } } }] });
```

### Example 3

```javascript
var navigate = function(panel, direction){ // This routine could contain business logic required to manage the navigation steps. // It would call setActiveItem as needed, manage navigation button state, handle any // branching logic that might be required, handle alternate actions like cancellation // or finalization, etc. A complete wizard implementation could get pretty // sophisticated depending on the complexity required, and should probably be // done as a subclass of CardLayout in a real-world implementation. var layout = panel.getLayout(); layout[direction](); Ext.getCmp('move-prev').setDisabled(!layout.getPrev()); Ext.getCmp('move-next').setDisabled(!layout.getNext()); }; Ext.create('Ext.panel.Panel', { title: 'Example Wizard', width: 300, height: 200, layout: 'card', bodyStyle: 'padding:15px', defaults: { // applied to each contained panel border: false }, // just an example of one possible navigation scheme, using buttons bbar: [ { id: 'move-prev', text: 'Back', handler: function(btn) { navigate(btn.up("panel"), "prev"); }, disabled: true }, '->', // greedy spacer so that the buttons are aligned to each side { id: 'move-next', text: 'Next', handler: function(btn) { navigate(btn.up("panel"), "next"); } } ], // the panels (or "cards") within the layout items: [{ id: 'card-0', html: '<h1>Welcome to the Wizard!</h1><p>Step 1 of 3</p>' },{ id: 'card-1', html: '<p>Step 2 of 3</p>' },{ id: 'card-2', html: '<h1>Congratulations!</h1><p>Step 3 of 3 - Complete</p>' }], renderTo: Ext.getBody() });
```

## Config options

If the individual contained items do not have a margins property specified or margin specified via CSS, the default margins from this property will be applied to each item. This property may be specified as an object containing margins to apply in the format: This property may also be specified as a string containing space-separated, numeric margin values. The order of the sides associated with each value matches the way CSS processes margin values: - If there is only one value, it applies to all sides. - If there are two values, the top and bottom borders are set to the first value and the right and left are set to the second. - If there are three values, the top is set to the first value, the left and right are set to the second, and the bottom is set to the third. - If there are four values, they apply to the top, right, bottom, and left, respectively. Defaults to: `{top: 0, right: 0, bottom: 0, left: 0}`

True to render each contained item at the time it becomes active, false to render all contained items as soon as the layout is rendered (defaults to false). If there is a significant amount of content or a lot of heavy controls being rendered into panels that are not displayed by default, setting this to true might improve performance. Defaults to: `false`

In addition to work done by our base classes, containers benefit from some extra cached data. The following properties are added to the ownerContext: - visibleItems: the result of getVisibleItems - childItems: the ContextItem[] for each visible item - targetContext: the ContextItem for the getTarget element

**Parameters:** ownerContext : Object


### beginLayoutCycle

Called before any calculation cycles to reset DOM values and prepare for calculation. This is a write phase and DOM reads should be strictly avoided when overridding this method.

**Parameters:** ownerContext : Ext.layout.ContextItemThe context item for the layout's owner component.


### cacheChildItems

...

**Parameters:** ownerContext : Object


### cacheElements

...


### calculate

Called to perform the calculations for this layout. ...

Called to perform the calculations for this layout. This method will be called at least once and may be called repeatedly if the done property is cleared before return to indicate that this layout is not yet done. The done property is always set to `true` before entering this method. This is a read phase and DOM writes should be strictly avoided in derived classes. Instead, DOM writes need to be written to Ext.layout.ContextItem objects to be flushed at the next opportunity.

**Parameters:** ownerContext : Ext.layout.ContextItemThe context item for the layout's owner component.


### callOverridden

Call the original method that was previously overridden with override This method has been **deprecated** as of 4.1. Use callParent instead.


### callParent

Call the "parent" method of the current method. ...

Call the "parent" method of the current method. That is the method previously overridden by derivation or by an override (see Ext.define). This can be used with an override as follows: This also works with static methods. Lastly, it also works with overridden static methods. To override a method and replace it and also call the superclass method, use callSuper. This is often done to patch a method to fix a bug.

**Parameters:** args : Array/ArgumentsThe arguments, either an array or the `arguments` object from the current method, for example: `this.callParent(arguments)`


### callSuper

This method is used by an override to call the superclass method but bypass any overridden method. ...

This method is used by an override to call the superclass method but bypass any overridden method. This is often done to "patch" a method that contains a bug but for whatever reason cannot be fixed directly. Consider: To patch the bug in `DerivedClass.method`, the typical solution is to create an override: The patch method cannot use `callParent` to call the superclass `method` since that would call the overridden method containing the bug. In other words, the above patch would only produce "Fixed" then "Good" in the console log, whereas, using `callParent` would produce "Fixed" then "Bad" then "Good".

**Parameters:** args : Array/ArgumentsThe arguments, either an array or the `arguments` object from the current method, for example: `this.callSuper(arguments)`


### completeLayout

This method (if implemented) is called at the end of the cycle in which this layout completes (by not setting done to `false` in calculate). It is possible for the layout to complete and yet become invalid before the end of the cycle, in which case, this method will not be called. It is also possible for this method to be called and then later the layout becomes invalidated. This will result in calculate being called again, followed by another call to this method. This is a read phase and DOM writes should be strictly avoided in derived classes. Instead, DOM writes need to be written to Ext.layout.ContextItem objects to be flushed at the next opportunity. This method need not be implemented by derived classes and, in fact, should only be implemented when needed.

**Parameters:** ownerContext : Ext.layout.ContextItemThe context item for the layout's owner component.


### configClass

**Parameters:** out : Object


### doRenderItems

...

**Parameters:** out : Object


### finalizeLayout

This method (if implemented) is called after all layouts have completed. ...

This method (if implemented) is called after all layouts have completed. In most ways this is similar to completeLayout. This call can cause this (or any layout) to be become invalid (see Ext.layout.Context.invalidate), but this is best avoided. This method is intended to be where final reads are made and so it is best to avoid invalidating layouts at this point whenever possible. Even so, this method can be used to perform final checks that may require all other layouts to be complete and then invalidate some results. This is a read phase and DOM writes should be strictly avoided in derived classes. Instead, DOM writes need to be written to Ext.layout.ContextItem objects to be flushed at the next opportunity. This method need not be implemented by derived classes and, in fact, should only be implemented when needed.

**Parameters:** ownerContext : Ext.layout.ContextItemThe context item for the layout's owner component.


### finishRender

...

Overrides: Ext.layout.Layout.finishRender


### finishRenderItems

...

**Parameters:** target : Object


### finishedLayout

This method is called after all layouts are complete and their calculations flushed to the DOM. ...

This method is called after all layouts are complete and their calculations flushed to the DOM. No further layouts will be run and this method is only called once per layout run. The base component layout caches `lastComponentSize`. This is a write phase and DOM reads should be avoided if possible when overridding this method. This method need not be implemented by derived classes and, in fact, should only be implemented when needed.

**Parameters:** ownerContext : Ext.layout.ContextItemThe context item for the layout's owner component.

Return the active (visible) component in the layout to the next card

**Returns:** Ext.ComponentThe next component or false.


### getPositionOffset

This method is used to offset the DOM position when checking whether the element is a certain child of the target. ...

This method is used to offset the DOM position when checking whether the element is a certain child of the target. This is required in cases where the extra elements prepended to the target before any of the items. An example of this is when using labelAlign: 'top' on a field. The label appears first in the DOM before any child items are created, so when we check the position we need to add an extra offset. Containers that create an innerCt are exempt because this new element preserves the order

**Parameters:** position : Object

Called by an owning Panel before the Panel begins its expand process. Most layouts will not need to override the default Ext.emptyFn implementation.


### beginLayout

In addition to work done by our base classes, containers benefit from some extra cached data. ...

In addition to work done by our base classes, containers benefit from some extra cached data. The following properties are added to the ownerContext: - visibleItems: the result of getVisibleItems - childItems: the ContextItem[] for each visible item - targetContext: the ContextItem for the getTarget element

**Parameters:** ownerContext : Object


### beginLayoutCycle

Called before any calculation cycles to reset DOM values and prepare for calculation. ...

Called before any calculation cycles to reset DOM values and prepare for calculation. This is a write phase and DOM reads should be strictly avoided when overridding this method.

**Parameters:** ownerContext : Ext.layout.ContextItemThe context item for the layout's owner component.


### cacheChildItems

...

**Parameters:** ownerContext : Object


### cacheElements

...


### calculate

Called to perform the calculations for this layout. ...

Called to perform the calculations for this layout. This method will be called at least once and may be called repeatedly if the done property is cleared before return to indicate that this layout is not yet done. The done property is always set to `true` before entering this method. This is a read phase and DOM writes should be strictly avoided in derived classes. Instead, DOM writes need to be written to Ext.layout.ContextItem objects to be flushed at the next opportunity.

**Parameters:** ownerContext : Ext.layout.ContextItemThe context item for the layout's owner component.


### callOverridden

Call the original method that was previously overridden with override This method has been **deprecated** as of 4.1. Use callParent instead.


### callParent

Call the "parent" method of the current method. ...

Call the "parent" method of the current method. That is the method previously overridden by derivation or by an override (see Ext.define). This can be used with an override as follows: This also works with static methods. Lastly, it also works with overridden static methods. To override a method and replace it and also call the superclass method, use callSuper. This is often done to patch a method to fix a bug.

**Parameters:** args : Array/ArgumentsThe arguments, either an array or the `arguments` object from the current method, for example: `this.callParent(arguments)`


### callSuper

This method is used by an override to call the superclass method but bypass any overridden method. ...

This method is used by an override to call the superclass method but bypass any overridden method. This is often done to "patch" a method that contains a bug but for whatever reason cannot be fixed directly. Consider: To patch the bug in `DerivedClass.method`, the typical solution is to create an override: The patch method cannot use `callParent` to call the superclass `method` since that would call the overridden method containing the bug. In other words, the above patch would only produce "Fixed" then "Good" in the console log, whereas, using `callParent` would produce "Fixed" then "Bad" then "Good".

**Parameters:** args : Array/ArgumentsThe arguments, either an array or the `arguments` object from the current method, for example: `this.callSuper(arguments)`


### completeLayout

This method (if implemented) is called at the end of the cycle in which this layout completes (by not setting done to `false` in calculate). It is possible for the layout to complete and yet become invalid before the end of the cycle, in which case, this method will not be called. It is also possible for this method to be called and then later the layout becomes invalidated. This will result in calculate being called again, followed by another call to this method. This is a read phase and DOM writes should be strictly avoided in derived classes. Instead, DOM writes need to be written to Ext.layout.ContextItem objects to be flushed at the next opportunity. This method need not be implemented by derived classes and, in fact, should only be implemented when needed.

**Parameters:** ownerContext : Ext.layout.ContextItemThe context item for the layout's owner component.

### finalizeLayout

This method (if implemented) is called after all layouts have completed. ...

This method (if implemented) is called after all layouts have completed. In most ways this is similar to completeLayout. This call can cause this (or any layout) to be become invalid (see Ext.layout.Context.invalidate), but this is best avoided. This method is intended to be where final reads are made and so it is best to avoid invalidating layouts at this point whenever possible. Even so, this method can be used to perform final checks that may require all other layouts to be complete and then invalidate some results. This is a read phase and DOM writes should be strictly avoided in derived classes. Instead, DOM writes need to be written to Ext.layout.ContextItem objects to be flushed at the next opportunity. This method need not be implemented by derived classes and, in fact, should only be implemented when needed.

**Parameters:** ownerContext : Ext.layout.ContextItemThe context item for the layout's owner component.

This method is used to offset the DOM position when checking whether the element is a certain child of the target. ...

This method is used to offset the DOM position when checking whether the element is a certain child of the target. This is required in cases where the extra elements prepended to the target before any of the items. An example of this is when using labelAlign: 'top' on a field.
