This configuration option is to be applied to **child items** of the container managed by this layout. Each child item with a flex property will be flexed (horizontally in `hbox`, vertically in `vbox`) according to each item's **relative** flex value compared to the sum of all items with a flex value specified. Any child items that have either a `flex = 0` or `flex = undefined` will not be 'flexed' (the initial size will not be changed).

**Parameters:** ownerContext : Object


### cacheElements

...

**Parameters:** ownerContext : Object


### calculate

Called to perform the calculations for this layout. ...

Called to perform the calculations for this layout. This method will be called at least once and may be called repeatedly if the done property is cleared before return to indicate that this layout is not yet done. The done property is always set to `true` before entering this method. This is a read phase and DOM writes should be strictly avoided in derived classes. Instead, DOM writes need to be written to Ext.layout.ContextItem objects to be flushed at the next opportunity.

**Parameters:** ownerContext : Ext.layout.ContextItemThe context item for the layout's owner component.

Call the original method that was previously overridden with override This method has been **deprecated** as of 4.1. Use callParent instead.


### callParent

Call the "parent" method of the current method. ...

Call the "parent" method of the current method. That is the method previously overridden by derivation or by an override (see Ext.define). This can be used with an override as follows: This also works with static methods. Lastly, it also works with overridden static methods. To override a method and replace it and also call the superclass method, use callSuper. This is often done to patch a method to fix a bug.

**Parameters:** args : Array/ArgumentsThe arguments, either an array or the `arguments` object from the current method, for example: `this.callParent(arguments)`


### callSuper

This method is used by an override to call the superclass method but bypass any overridden method. ...

This method is used by an override to call the superclass method but bypass any overridden method. This is often done to "patch" a method that contains a bug but for whatever reason cannot be fixed directly. Consider: To patch the bug in `DerivedClass.method`, the typical solution is to create an override: The patch method cannot use `callParent` to call the superclass `method` since that would call the overridden method containing the bug. In other words, the above patch would only produce "Fixed" then "Good" in the console log, whereas, using `callParent` would produce "Fixed" then "Bad" then "Good".

**Parameters:** args : Array/ArgumentsThe arguments, either an array or the `arguments` object from the current method, for example: `this.callSuper(arguments)`


### completeLayout

This method (if implemented) is called at the end of the cycle in which this layout completes (by not setting done to `false` in calculate). It is possible for the layout to complete and yet become invalid before the end of the cycle, in which case, this method will not be called. It is also possible for this method to be called and then later the layout becomes invalidated. This will result in calculate being called again, followed by another call to this method. This is a read phase and DOM writes should be strictly avoided in derived classes. Instead, DOM writes need to be written to Ext.layout.ContextItem objects to be flushed at the next opportunity. This method need not be implemented by derived classes and, in fact, should only be implemented when needed.

**Parameters:** ownerContext : Ext.layout.ContextItemThe context item for the layout's owner component.

### finalizeLayout

This method (if implemented) is called after all layouts have completed. ...

This method (if implemented) is called after all layouts have completed. In most ways this is similar to completeLayout. This call can cause this (or any layout) to be become invalid (see Ext.layout.Context.invalidate), but this is best avoided. This method is intended to be where final reads are made and so it is best to avoid invalidating layouts at this point whenever possible. Even so, this method can be used to perform final checks that may require all other layouts to be complete and then invalidate some results. This is a read phase and DOM writes should be strictly avoided in derived classes. Instead, DOM writes need to be written to Ext.layout.ContextItem objects to be flushed at the next opportunity. This method need not be implemented by derived classes and, in fact, should only be implemented when needed.

**Parameters:** ownerContext : Ext.layout.ContextItemThe context item for the layout's owner component.

This method is called after all layouts are complete and their calculations flushed to the DOM. ...

This method is called after all layouts are complete and their calculations flushed to the DOM. No further layouts will be run and this method is only called once per layout run. The base component layout caches `lastComponentSize`. This is a write phase and DOM reads should be avoided if possible when overridding this method. This method need not be implemented by derived classes and, in fact, should only be implemented when needed.

**Parameters:** ownerContext : Ext.layout.ContextItemThe context item for the layout's owner component.

**Returns:** an array of child components either for a render phase (Performed in the beforeLayout method of the layout's base class), or the layout phase (onLayout). ReturnsExt.Component[]of child components


### getPositionOffset

This method is used to offset the DOM position when checking whether the element is a certain child of the target. ...

This method is used to offset the DOM position when checking whether the element is a certain child of the target. This is required in cases where the extra elements prepended to the target before any of the items. An example of this is when using labelAlign: 'top' on a field. The label appears first in the DOM before any child items are created, so when we check the position we need to add an extra offset. Containers that create an innerCt are exempt because this new element preserves the order

**Parameters:** position : Object


### getRenderData

Called to perform the calculations for this layout. This method will be called at least once and may be called repeatedly if the done property is cleared before return to indicate that this layout is not yet done. The done property is always set to `true` before entering this method. This is a read phase and DOM writes should be strictly avoided in derived classes.

Call the original method that was previously overridden with override This method has been **deprecated** as of 4.1. Use callParent instead.


### callParent

Call the "parent" method of the current method. ...

Call the "parent" method of the current method. That is the method previously overridden by derivation or by an override (see Ext.define). This can be used with an override as follows: This also works with static methods. Lastly, it also works with overridden static methods. To override a method and replace it and also call the superclass method, use callSuper. This is often done to patch a method to fix a bug.

**Parameters:** args : Array/ArgumentsThe arguments, either an array or the `arguments` object from the current method, for example: `this.callParent(arguments)`


### callSuper

This method is used by an override to call the superclass method but bypass any overridden method. ...

This method is used by an override to call the superclass method but bypass any overridden method. This is often done to "patch" a method that contains a bug but for whatever reason cannot be fixed directly. Consider: To patch the bug in `DerivedClass.method`, the typical solution is to create an override: The patch method cannot use `callParent` to call the superclass `method` since that would call the overridden method containing the bug. In other words, the above patch would only produce "Fixed" then "Good" in the console log, whereas, using `callParent` would produce "Fixed" then "Bad" then "Good".

**Parameters:** args : Array/ArgumentsThe arguments, either an array or the `arguments` object from the current method, for example: `this.callSuper(arguments)`


### completeLayout

This method (if implemented) is called at the end of the cycle in which this layout completes (by not setting done to `false` in calculate). It is possible for the layout to complete and yet become invalid before the end of the cycle, in which case, this method will not be called. It is also possible for this method to be called and then later the layout becomes invalidated. This will result in calculate being called again, followed by another call to this method. This is a read phase and DOM writes should be strictly avoided in derived classes. Instead, DOM writes need to be written to Ext.layout.ContextItem objects to be flushed at the next opportunity. This method need not be implemented by derived classes and, in fact, should only be implemented when needed.

**Parameters:** ownerContext : Ext.layout.ContextItemThe context item for the layout's owner component.

### finalizeLayout

This method (if implemented) is called after all layouts have completed. ...

This method (if implemented) is called after all layouts have completed. In most ways this is similar to completeLayout. This call can cause this (or any layout) to be become invalid (see Ext.layout.Context.invalidate), but this is best avoided. This method is intended to be where final reads are made and so it is best to avoid invalidating layouts at this point whenever possible. Even so, this method can be used to perform final checks that may require all other layouts to be complete and then invalidate some results. This is a read phase and DOM writes should be strictly avoided in derived classes. Instead, DOM writes need to be written to Ext.layout.ContextItem objects to be flushed at the next opportunity. This method need not be implemented by derived classes and, in fact, should only be implemented when needed.

**Parameters:** ownerContext : Ext.layout.ContextItemThe context item for the layout's owner component.

### getPositionOffset

This method is used to offset the DOM position when checking whether the element is a certain child of the target. ...

This method is used to offset the DOM position when checking whether the element is a certain child of the target. This is required in cases where the extra elements prepended to the target before any of the items. An example of this is when using labelAlign: 'top' on a field. The label appears first in the DOM before any child items are created, so when we check the position we need to add an extra offset. Containers that create an innerCt are exempt because this new element preserves the order

**Parameters:** position : Object
