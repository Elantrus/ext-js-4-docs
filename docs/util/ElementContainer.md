# Ext.util.ElementContainer

**Extends:** Ext.Base

## Description

**NOTE** This is a private utility class for internal use by the framework. Don't rely on its existence.

This mixin enables classes to declare relationships to child elements and provides the mechanics for acquiring the elements and storing them on an object instance as properties.

This class is used by components and container layouts to manage their child elements.

A typical component that uses these features might look something like this:

Ext.define('Ext.ux.SomeComponent', { extend: 'Ext.Component', childEls: [ 'bodyEl' ], renderTpl: [ '<div id="{id}-bodyEl"></div>' ], // ... }); The `childEls` array lists one or more relationships to child elements managed by the component. The items in this array can be either of the following types:

The example above could have used this instead to achieve the same result:

childEls: [ { name: 'bodyEl', itemId: 'bodyEl' } ] When using `select`, the property will be an instance of Ext.CompositeElement. In all other cases, the property will be an Ext.Element or `null` if not found.

Care should be taken when using `select` or `selectNode` to find child elements. The following issues should be considered:

This above issues are most important when using `select` since it returns multiple elements.

**IMPORTANT** Unlike a `renderTpl` where there is a single value for an instance, `childEls` are aggregated up the class hierarchy so that they are effectively inherited. In other words, if a class where to derive from `Ext.ux.SomeComponent` in the example above, it could also have a `childEls` property in the same way as `Ext.ux.SomeComponent`.

Ext.define('Ext.ux.AnotherComponent', { extend: 'Ext.ux.SomeComponent', childEls: [ // 'bodyEl' is inherited 'innerEl' ], renderTpl: [ '<div id="{id}-bodyEl">' '<div id="{id}-innerEl"></div>' '</div>' ], // ... }); The `renderTpl` contains both child elements and unites them in the desired markup, but the `childEls` only contains the new child element. The applyChildEls method takes care of looking up all `childEls` for an instance and considers `childEls` properties on all the super classes and mixins.

**Type:** Boolean

...

Defaults to: `true`


### self

**Type:** Ext.Class

Get the reference to the current class from which this object was instantiated. ...

Get the reference to the current class from which this object was instantiated. Unlike statics, `this.self` is scope-dependent and it's meant to be used for dynamic inheritance. See statics for a detailed comparison


### $onExtended

**Type:** Array

...

Defaults to: `[]`


### Ext.util.ElementContainer

...

**Returns:** Ext.util.ElementContainer


### addChildEls

Adds each argument passed to this method to the childEls array. ...

Adds each argument passed to this method to the childEls array.


### applyChildEls

Sets references to elements inside the component. ...

Sets references to elements inside the component.

**Parameters:** el : Object


### callOverridden

Call the original method that was previously overridden with override Ext.define('My.Cat', { constructor: functi...

Call the original method that was previously overridden with override This method has been **deprecated** as of 4.1. Use callParent instead.


### callParent

Call the "parent" method of the current method. ...

Call the "parent" method of the current method. That is the method previously overridden by derivation or by an override (see Ext.define). This can be used with an override as follows: This also works with static methods. Lastly, it also works with overridden static methods. To override a method and replace it and also call the superclass method, use callSuper. This is often done to patch a method to fix a bug.

**Parameters:** args : Array/ArgumentsThe arguments, either an array or the `arguments` object from the current method, for example: `this.callParent(arguments)`


### callSuper

This method is used by an override to call the superclass method but bypass any overridden method. ...

This method is used by an override to call the superclass method but bypass any overridden method. This is often done to "patch" a method that contains a bug but for whatever reason cannot be fixed directly. Consider: To patch the bug in `DerivedClass.method`, the typical solution is to create an override: The patch method cannot use `callParent` to call the superclass `method` since that would call the overridden method containing the bug. In other words, the above patch would only produce "Fixed" then "Good" in the console log, whereas, using `callParent` would produce "Fixed" then "Bad" then "Good".

**Parameters:** args : Array/ArgumentsThe arguments, either an array or the `arguments` object from the current method, for example: `this.callSuper(arguments)`

### setConfig

...

**Parameters:** config : Object


### statics

### override

Override members of this class. ...
