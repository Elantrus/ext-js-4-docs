# Ext.EventObject

**Extends:** Ext.Base

## Description

Just as Ext.Element wraps around a native DOM node, Ext.EventObject wraps the browser's native event-object normalizing cross-browser differences, such as which mouse button is clicked, keys pressed, mechanisms to stop event-propagation along with a method to prevent default actions from taking place.

For example:

Call the "parent" method of the current method. ...

Call the "parent" method of the current method. That is the method previously overridden by derivation or by an override (see Ext.define). This can be used with an override as follows: This also works with static methods. Lastly, it also works with overridden static methods. To override a method and replace it and also call the superclass method, use callSuper. This is often done to patch a method to fix a bug.

**Parameters:** args : Array/ArgumentsThe arguments, either an array or the `arguments` object from the current method, for example: `this.callParent(arguments)`


### callSuper

This method is used by an override to call the superclass method but bypass any overridden method. ...

This method is used by an override to call the superclass method but bypass any overridden method. This is often done to "patch" a method that contains a bug but for whatever reason cannot be fixed directly. Consider: To patch the bug in `DerivedClass.method`, the typical solution is to create an override: The patch method cannot use `callParent` to call the superclass `method` since that would call the overridden method containing the bug. In other words, the above patch would only produce "Fixed" then "Good" in the console log, whereas, using `callParent` would produce "Fixed" then "Bad" then "Good".

**Parameters:** args : Array/ArgumentsThe arguments, either an array or the `arguments` object from the current method, for example: `this.callSuper(arguments)`
